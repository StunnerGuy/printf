# 0x11. C - printf

## Description
This is a team project between OSHISANYA TOKUNBO and AL-MUKHTAR JAMILAT LADIDI. We are ALX Africa software engineering program students. This project involves a function named '_printf'. The _printf function will imitate the actual 'printf' command located in the <stdio.h> library.
## Prototype

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

## Requirements

1. All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.4 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

2. All files ended with a new line

3. Code used the Betty programming style

4. Global variables were not used

5. The prototypes of all functions were included in the header file called 'main.h'

6. All header files were include guarded

## Usage
1. Prints a string to the standard output according to a given format.

2. The _printf() is a variadic function that accepts arguments and replaces the tags written in the strings.

3. If the program runs successfully, the return value is the amount of chars printed or -1 otherwise.
## Example
Print the string of characters in "Hello World":

1. Input: _printf("Hello World!");
2. Output: Hello World!
## Learning Points on the projects
1. How to use GitHub for collaboration projects
2. How to apply variadic functions
3. The complexities of the printf function
4. Finding a good workflow
